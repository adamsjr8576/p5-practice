### Daily p5.js Sketches

## Objective
 - To gain familiarity with creating visual interactions and animations via p5.js. The goal is to create a new sketch each day
 for 30 days. By creative coding daily I intend to finetune my ability to create visual interactions and experiences via p5.js.
 This is meant to further my work as a front-end developer and lead to more engaging and creative web designs.
